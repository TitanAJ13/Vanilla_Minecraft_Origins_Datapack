<h1>Minecraft Vanilla Origins Datapack</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Datapack for <b>Vanilla Minecraft 1.21</b></li>
    <li>Inspired by the <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/origins">Origins Mod</a></li>
    <li>Should work on Singleplayer, Multiplayer Servers, and Realms</li>
</ul>
<p><b>*NOTE: Not tested with Vanilla Tweaks yet: May interfere with other datapacks</b></p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This datapack attempts to add many of the origins present in the base <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/origins">Origins Mod</a> and some add-ons presented in the <a href="https://origins-smp.fandom.com/wiki/Origins">Origins SMP</a>. It is NOT an add-on to the Origins Mod, but instead aims to provide a similar experience for players without access to mods, such as those on Minecraft Realms. As such, it cannot do everything the mod can, so several abilities were reworked or rebalanced to work inside a datapack. The chosen Origins and their abilities are listed below. In addition to the abilities, many new enchantments and advancements were added that correspond with certain strengths or weaknesses, and some new crafting recipes help with balancing. Furthermore, new items are under development to reward players who explore the depths of this datapack and its features.</p>
<p>After a few updates, this datapack IS now structured as a framework for others to create similar add-on datapacks of their own like with the mod. Additionally, there are now settings within the game to change if players want to modify the existing ability balancing. There are likely many bugs present, but these are being looked into and any feedback would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>The hand-made <a href="https://titanaj13.github.io/Vanilla_Minecraft_Origins_Datapack/">Wiki Site</a> contains more detailed information regarding Settings, Add-Ons, and datapack features. Additional feedback regarding the website is also welcome and appreciated!</p>
