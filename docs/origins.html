                <h1>Origins</h1>
                <p> Origins are generally mob-based sets of abilities that change how players experience the game. Each Origin has strengths
                    and weaknesses that try to maintain good balance and not create anything too overpowered or underpowered. Canonically,
                    they are humanoid races with many different backgrounds and cultures that may still live on in the different Minecraft
                    dimensions. There are 13 different Origins that come premade in this datapack, but most abilities are structured so that
                    players can create their own Origins as well. See <a href="add-ons.html">Add-Ons</a> for more details.

            <h1>List of Origins</h1>
            <p>All of the Origins listed below are inspired by the Origins Mod and some player created add-ons, but NOT all abilities are the
                exact same. Notably, the <a href="phantom.html">Phantom</a>, <a href="feline.html">Feline</a>,
                <a href="inchling.html">Inchling</a>, and <a href="shulk.html">Shulk</a> have had their major abilities changed due to datapack
                limitations. Other abilities that required the use of a primary or secondary key have mostly been adapted to use in-game features
                instead, and some abilities involving items have been changed as well.
            </p>

                        <p>Agile creatures that pounce in the night, jumping high as they sprint towards their prey. Just like a cat, they have nine lives and survive on a pescatarian diet.</p>
